# Dam Level in a Hydroelectric Power Plant During a Flood

The recorded data presented here, are based on information from the **automatic hydraulic control** for the month of July 2020. 
In this period there was a **flood** going **from 20.46%** of the useful volume of the dam **to 86.27%** in less than **20 days**. 
The records were recorded at a time interval of 1h, for 31 days, corresponding to 744 records.

**Barra Grande** hydroelectric power plant is located on the Pelotas River, about 43 kilometers from its confluence with the Canoas River, between the cities of Anita Garibaldi and Pinhal da Serra, Brazil.

This power plant has an installed capacity of **690MW**, with a **94kmÂ² reservoir** and a **185m high dam**. Based on its characteristics, it has a capacity equivalent to 24% of the demand in the state in which it is installed (Santa Catarina state, Brazil).

To perform an evaluation of the possible scenarios in a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) time series, noise is included randomly. Using this data, it is possible to evaluate the original signal, as well as two possible scenarios with higher noise intensity (_x1_ and _x2_), as can be seen:

# Wavelet-Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention model

This repository presents an algorithm called Wavelet-Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention.

> The **wavelet transform** makes noise reduction for chaotic time series.

> The **seq2seq-LSTM** makes predictions based on the history of variation in the dam level of the hydroelectric plant.

> The **attention mechanism** assigns appropriate weight to each encoder's hidden state output, and maps them to the output sequence, solving the problem of having a weak memory about the previous time steps in a long time series.

**Please go ahead and try it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SFStefenon/DamLevelHydroelectric/blob/main/Wavelet-Seq2Seq-LSTM-Attention.ipynb)!**
 
The architecture of the proposed model is as follows:
