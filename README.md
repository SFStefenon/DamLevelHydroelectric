Level of Dams in a Hydraulic Power Plant During a Flood



data from the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant (located on the Pelotas River, about 43 kilometers from its confluence with the Canoas River, between the cities of Anita Garibaldi/SC and Pinhal da Serra/RS, Brazil), which has approximately 90km$^2$ of a reservoir with a 185m high dam. The spillway discharge curve that defines the emergency situation is presented in Figure \ref{spill}. 

The plant where the analysis was carried out has an installed ca-
pacity of 690 MW, with a 94 km reservoir and a 185 m high dam. Based
on its characteristics, it has a capacity equivalent to 24 % of the demand
in the state in which it is installed (Santa Catarina state, Brazil).
The recorded data are based on information from the automatic
hydraulic control for the month of July 2020. This period was evaluated
considering that there was a flood during the month in question, going
from 20.46 % of its useful volume to 86.27 % in less than 20 days during
the evaluated period. The records were recorded at a time interval of 1 h,
for 31 days, corresponding to 744 records
