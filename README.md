# Dam Level in a Hydroelectric Power Plant During a Flood

The recorded data presented here, are based on information from the **automatic hydraulic control** for the month of July 2020. 
In this period there was a **flood** going **from 20.46%** of the useful volume of the dam **to 86.27%** in less than **20 days**. 
The records were recorded at a time interval of 1h, for 31 days, corresponding to 744 records.

**Barra Grande** hydroelectric power plant is located on the Pelotas River, about 43 kilometers from its confluence with the Canoas River, between the cities of Anita Garibaldi/SC and Pinhal da Serra/RS, Brazil.

This power plant has an installed capacity of **690MW**, with a **94km2 reservoir** and a **185m high dam**. Based on its characteristics, it has a capacity equivalent to 24% of the demand in the state in which it is installed (Santa Catarina state, Brazil).

To perform an evaluation of the possible scenarios in a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) time series, noise is included randomly. Using this data, it is possible to evaluate the original signal, as well as two possible scenarios with higher noise intensity.
